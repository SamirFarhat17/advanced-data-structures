# Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures EC504

## Course Overview
This course explores advanced algorithms and data structures, building on foundational knowledge of basic data structures and algorithmic techniques. The syllabus is divided into four main modules:
1. **Introductory Material and Review**: Asymptotic analysis and a review of basic data structures.
2. **Advanced Data Structures**: B-Trees, Van Emde Boas Trees, Fibonacci Heaps, and Disjoint Set Data Structures.
3. **Algorithmic Design**: Divide and Conquer, Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, and Network Flow.
4. **Intractability**: NP-Completeness, PSPACE-Completeness, and Approximation Algorithms.

Through a combination of theoretical study and practical implementation, students will gain a deep understanding of these topics and their applications in solving complex computational problems.
